GUI Modifications:
Implemented buttons for step-by-step execution: Added buttons for controlling the simulation flow, allowing users to step through cache accesses one by one.
File dialog for program loading: Integrated a file loading dialog to allow users to load program files directly from the GUI. This required backend modifications to properly initialize the memory based on the loaded program.
Interactive Controls: Enabled controls for users to input memory access sequences, facilitating real-time simulation of the memory and cache behavior.
